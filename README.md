# [BrewSource | Raspberry Pi Project](http://brewsource.no) - :snake:Python

BrewSource is an open source, Raspberry Pi-powered monitor for your beer fermentation :beers:. Written in :snake:Python and :sailboat:Sails.js. We'd love help of any kind, whether you'd like to contribute by submitting a bug, or have a request for a feature. You can also contribute with development, but please read the guidelines on [Contribution](#contribution) before you begin.

## Getting Started
- You will also need [Python 3.x.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the Raspberry Pi in order to get the temperature-monitoring and camera stream going.
- The thermometer script is dependent on a package called _pymongo_
- You'll also need a [DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Temperature Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/381) to read temperatures
- After you've cloned the repository:

- Open a terminal, navigate to your local clone (folder), and type:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install pymongo
```

- You'll need to create an account, a brewery, and finally a batch which the temperatures belong to
- Copy the ID of the batch you want to monitor, and paste it in the "batchID" variable in the _thermometer.py_ script

- Finally, open the folder _temperature_. Type:
```sh
sudo python thermometer.py
```

**The launcher.sh script is used to run the python script on reboot**

_In order to get this working, you'll need to do the following:_

```sh

sudo crontab -e

@reboot sh /home/pi/brewpi/launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1

```
